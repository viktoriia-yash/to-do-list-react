# To-Do List Page
Since my coding learning is too slow (I took too much everything), I arranged a personal coding marathon for a whole week. The main goal - do one project per day from 28.06.2023 to 04.07.2023.
<br />
This is my fourth project in this marathon - To-do list page. Like a previous one, it's also a very simple project, where I used only React, HTML, and CSS.

### Technology & Resources Used:
1. React, HTML5, and CSS3
